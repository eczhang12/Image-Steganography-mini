            <h2>What is Steganography?</h2>
            <p>Steganography, derived from the Greek Words "steganos" (meaning covered or concealed) and "graphein" (meaning writing), is the art and science of hiding information within other non-secret data or physical objects. The primary goal of steganography is to conceal the very existence of a message, making it invisible to an unsuspecting observer.</p>
            <h3>A Brief History</h3>
            <p>The practice of steganography dates back to ancient times. One of the earliest recorded examples come from ancient Greece, where Histiaeus, a Greek tyrant, shaved a slave's head, tattooed a message on his scalp, and then waited for his hair to grow back before sending him. Another historical example involved writing messages on wooden tablets and covering them with wax, making them appear as blank tablets.</p>
            <h3>General Principle</h3>
            <p>At its core, steganography leverages the redundancy or "noise" inherent in various media. By making subtle alterations to these imperceptible parts of a cover medium (like an image, audio file, or video), a secret message can be embedded without visibly or audibly changing the original file. The effectiveness relies on the human perception system's limitations.</p>
            <h3>Types of Digital Steganography</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Image Steganography:</strong> Hiding data within image files by manipulating pixels</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Steganography:</strong> Embedding messages in audio files by manipulating sound frequences, echo, or other properties.</li>
                <li><strong>Video Steganography:</strong> A more complex form, hiding data within video frames, essentially applying image steganography to a sequence of images.</li>
                <li><strong>Text Steganography:</strong> Concealing information within text files by manipulating formatting (spaces, tabs, font styles), using specific word choices, or even hidden characters.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>About Image Steganography</h2>
            <p>We are just going to explore image steganography though as it is the easiest to understand.</p>
            
            <h3>How Digital Images Store Information</h3>
            <p>To understand image steganography, it is essential to grasp how digital images are represented. Most digital images are composed of a grid of tiny squares called <strong>pixels</strong>. Each pixel contains color information, typically represented using the Red, Green, and Blue channel (RGB) color model. Each channel has 256 values (0 to 255), meaning that every channel must be represented by a byte (8 bits). As such, the RGB Model primarily uses 3 bytes to represent every pixel.</p>
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>RGBA (Red, Blue, Green, Alpha):</strong> PNGs often use the RGBA model that is based off the RGB model with an extra dimension, Alpha. The Alpha channel represents the opacity or transparency of the color and determines how much of the background or underlying elements will show through.
            </div>
            <h3>Least Significant Bit (LSB) Encoding in Detail</h3>
            <p>This demo primarily uses <strong>LSB</strong> encoding, which is the simplest and most widely known technique. Imagine a pixel with a Red value of 220. In binary, 220 is <code>11011100</code>. The last bit (`0`) is the Least Significant Bit (LSB). If we change this bit, the new value becomes <code>11011101</code> which is 221. A change from 220 to 221 is almost impossible for the human eye to detect. This means that we can embed the bits of our message in these Least Significant Bits, but as you will find below, the more bits you change, the more distortion there is, eventually becoming very noticable.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Other types of Encoding:</strong> As mentioned earlier, LSB encoding is the simplest encoding scheme, and as such makes it <strong>very easy</strong> to decode. There are plenty of other different encoding techniques that take into account lossy compression, image noise, and other aspects.

            <p>The algorithm works by:</p>
            <ol style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                <li><strong>Converting the message to binary:</strong> Each character becomes a sequence of 8 bits</li>
                <li><strong>Iterating through image pixels:</strong> Starting from the top-left, we process each pixel's RGB values</li>
                <li><strong>Replacing LSBs:</strong> The least significant bits of each color channel are replaced with message bits</li>
                <li><strong>Marking the end:</strong> A special delimiter indicates where the message ends</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Security Note:</strong> While LSB steganography is simple and effective for hiding data, it's not secure against statistical analysis. For real security applications, more sophisticated techniques and encryption should be used.
